<h1>Comparing OCC Model of Emotions with ACT's Emotional Predictions on Steamboat Willie, Disney Studio, 1928</h1>

<p>
IN this paper I would present a detailed analysis of Steamboat Willie, a Disney Studio, 1928 movie to compare the emotional predictions of OCC Model of Emotions with that of Affect Control Theory (ACT). It consists of an empirical study to test the idea that many appraisal rules of OCC Model are implicitly encoded in ACT. Similarly to applying OCC rules to movies/books, this project involves labeling the scenes in ACT's subject-verb-object format to see which emotions Interact comes up with. The hypothesis is that there will be a huge overlap, which would suggest that it may be possible to get rid of many explicit rules, as they kind of emerge from the more general algorithm used in Interact.
In section II I briefly discuss OCC Model of Emotion and  Affect Control Theory and why a Disney Studio animation movie is a better choice to compare these models in terms of their emotional predictions. In section III I present a vignette for the Steamboat Willie and subsequently convert that vignette in a sequence of events in ACT's subject-verb-object format. I used INTERACT to evaluate ACT's emotional predictions for Steamboat Willie scenes. In Section IV OCC model's appraisal rules are applied on selected frames of the movie, and the emotional predictions of ACT are presented. Secion V concludes the paper with a brief analysis of the results of the study.
